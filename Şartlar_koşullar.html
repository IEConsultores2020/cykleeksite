                    solely between the involved and prices shown in Cykleek for materials correspond to current market

                    discretional of the parties involved and in case they choose the Payment platforms indicated,
                    they naturally follow the specific conditions of use of those platforms with no responsibility

                <p align="justify">
                    Cykleek enables the connection between parties interested in selling, buying, exchanging, donating
                    or paying for the partial or final disposal or treatment of waste, including any second hand or
                    refused materials that can still be refurbished, transformed, reused, recovered (e.g. for
                    composting, energy generation, edible foods, raw materials) or recycled in any way without affecting
                    the environment or breaching the concerned regulations. Only as a Platform (website, app) to
                    facilitate better ways of managing waste and reusable materials, Cykleek has no liability of the
                    consequences of mishandling, wrong disposing, misuse or any other negative effect by errors or
                    omissions causing adverse results against the persons involved (injuries, losses), third parties,
                    the environment or the respective waste management legislation on the jurisdiction where the
                    transactions take place, including eventual cross-border transport of the materials in question (see
                    <a href="https://www.basel.int/" target="_blank">https://www.basel.int/</a> ). The types and
                    quantities of the materials transacted should correspond to
                    the classifications, units and quantities indicated on the lists in our Platform (website, app) and
                    Cykleek is neither responsible for dangers of misleading descriptions, mislabelling substances or
                    materials that can be considered or become hazardous. For second hand materials to be sold or
                    donated, it is recommended to use our site to describe the objects, including pictures, stating
                    their condition before engaging in any transaction and, again, Cykleek naturally is not responsible
                    either for the quality or the specifications (e.g. brand, condition, model) of the objects offered.
                </p>

                    <strong>NOTICE of RISK</strong>
                </h3>
                <p align="justify">
                    All materials considered waste (used, discarded, degraded) may pose risks for the environment,
                    persons directly involved on its manipulation or indirectly when dispersed, spilled or dumped on the
                    air, water or the soil, especially if not properly disposed, treated or transformed. Parties
                    involved in any of the options mentioned must be aware of the appropriate ways of handling the
                    materials while processing, transforming, treating, disposing or transporting. Be aware that the
                    ignorance of the related laws & regulations does not absolve the responsibilities of the parties
                    involved. As it is stated here, Cykleek in good faith promotes best practices of managing waste and
                    second-hand materials but is not liable for eventual negative impacts yet it is highly advised that
                    before embarking in any transaction, specially involving paying for treatment or disposal of waste,
                    including its transport, that the procedures performed fully comply with the local environmental
                    laws protecting air, water, soil, plants and animals. Similarly, some materials demand compliance
                    with concrete requirements during transport that are exclusive responsibility of the part paying and
                    the part providing that service.
