                                        that one of the main problems that hinders a real change is to claim delusive
                                        achievements announcing that products or processes are sustainable, green,
                                        eco,
                                        climate smart, neutral or any of the plentiful expressions and terms that
                                        saturate media, ads, public opinion and even sectors of the academy. At the

                                        time, it is evident that rising emissions and increasing degradation go

                                            After a rapid economic growth Japan, being a highly densely populated
                                            island
                                            nation, quickly faced a problem with their residues and started to think
                                            how
                                            to overcome that challenge. Twenty years ago (in 2004), Japan´s Prime
                                            Minister, Mr Junichiro Koizumi, introduced the 3R (REDUCE, REUSE and
                                            RECYCLE) initiative, coinciding with intellectuals, activists and
                                            responsible citizens around the world that we have gone too far on an
                                            unsustainable Planet. Nine years after, Bea Johnson- in her book Zero
                                            Waste
                                            Home- complemented the Rs adding REFUSE and ROT (i.e. compost). In the last
                                            decade more
                                            Rs
                                            have been proposed, reaching 7R with RETHINK and REPAIR and even 10 Rs
                                            with
                                            the introduction of REFURBISH, REPURPOSE AND RECOVER. Others talk about
                                            REMANUFACTURE and more synonyms that basically go on to the same
                                            direction.
                                            At Cykleek All these Rs Can Happen and we are enthusiastic to promote
                                            their
                                            practice regardless of their names, with special interest on those that
                                            AVOID a product or routine consuming resources (“The best waste is the
                                            one
                                            that is not generated”) like REFUSE (e.g. to stop using Styrofoam to
                                            pack
                                            lunchboxes!) or RETHINK (e.g. taking PUBLIC TRANSPORT or even better,
                                            WALKING or BIKING as possible).
