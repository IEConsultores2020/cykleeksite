Farklı göstergeler mevcut olsa da, Karbon dioksit Emisyonları, küresel ısınma üzerindeki kritik etkileri ve yaşam tarzımız ve günlük tüketim alışkanlıklarımızla doğrudan bağlantılı olduğu için seçilmiştir. Kaynak kullanımı optimize edildiğinde, su, enerji ve hammadde de korunmuş olur, bu yüzden Cykleek her kullanıldığında, kaynak tasarrufuna somut bir katkı sağlanmış olur. Etkinin boyutu ne olursa olsun, her azaltılmış emisyon önemlidir ve hepimiz günümüzde karşılaştığımız en büyük küresel tehditlerden biri olan İklim Değişikliğini durdurmaya katkıda bulunabiliriz.",
    "AntiGreenwashingStatement": "Anti greenwashing statement",
    "AntiGreenwashingStatementAtCykleek": "At Cykleek we definitely think that one of the main problems that hinders a real change is to claim delusive achievements announcing that products or processes are sustainable, green, eco, climate smart, neutral or any of the plentiful expressions and terms that  saturate media, ads, public opinion and even sectors of the academy. At the same time, it is evident that rising emissions and increasing degradation go hand in hand with those misleading claims, keeping business as usual and suffocating true efforts to stop the devastation. Cykleek decisively commits to combat Greenwashing and will cautiously screen entities that want to join our community and pretend to use it for those dubious purposes. ",
    "ShortStoryRs": "Short Story of the Rs",
    "ShortStoryRsFewGenerations": "Few generations back, concepts like recycling, reusing, reducing or repurposing were far from the public domain in the same sense of today. Despite that, those practices were more observed on a spontaneous way, in accordance to other lifestyles. For the first time in history and since 2007 the Urban Population exceeded the Rural one worldwide. Nowadays the urgency of more sustainable world goes without saying and probably no one disagrees on that, but at the same time complexities in a growing Urban world increase and practicing the Rs is not that straightforward despite the surge of awareness and hype associated.",
    "ShortStoryRsAsPossible": "After a rapid economic growth Japan, being a highly densely populated island nation, quickly faced a problem with their residues and started to think  how to overcome that challenge. Twenty years ago (in 2004), Japan´s Prime Minister, Mr Junichiro Koizumi, introduced the 3R (REDUCE, REUSE and RECYCLE) initiative, coinciding with intellectuals, activists and responsible citizens around the world that we have gone too far on an unsustainable Planet. Nine years after, Bea Johnson- in her book Zero Waste Home- complemented the Rs adding REFUSE and ROT (i.e. compost). In the last decade more Rs have been proposed, reaching 7R with RETHINK and REPAIR and even 10 Rs with the introduction of REFURBISH, REPURPOSE AND RECOVER. Others talk about REMANUFACTURE and more synonyms that basically go on to the same direction. At Cykleek All these Rs Can Happen and we are enthusiastic to promote their practice regardless of their names, with special interest on those that AVOID a product or routine consuming resources (“The best waste is the one that is not generated”) like REFUSE (e.g. to stop using Styrofoam to pack lunchboxes!) or RETHINK (e.g. taking PUBLIC TRANSPORT or even better, WALKING or BIKING as possible).",
